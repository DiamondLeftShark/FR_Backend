## Installation and Setup
This program runs in Node and uses Node Package Manager (NPM) to automatically download and check any required dependencies.  After downloading this repo:

1. Install Node/NPM at https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm (if they are not already installed).
2. Navigate to this repo's root directory (the directory with package.json) and run the following command:

```npm install```

This should install all required packages and dependencies.

3. Once installed, the program can be started using the following command:

```npm run start-prod```

If successful, you will see a notification that the program is listening for requests on localhost:3000.  The port number can be changed as needed by editing the port variable in server/index.js and restarting the program.

## Routes
TBD: routes and expected parameters.
